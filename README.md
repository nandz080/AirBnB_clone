0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
Project Description: Python Airbnb Clone Console

In this project, you will create a simplified version of Airbnb's console using Python. The console will allow users to perform various operations such as creating and managing listings, making reservations, and handling user authentication. Although it won't have the full functionality of Airbnb, it will serve as a basic clone.
